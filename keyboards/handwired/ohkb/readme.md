Look, a readme.md file!

This is spectacular!

I... I must go tell everyone!

Ok, but seriously:

# OHKB

An open-source split keyboard, inspired by the [dygma raise](https://dygma.com/pages/dygma-raise-2), [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/), and the [Happy Hacking Keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/) (as well as a stubborn insistance that '6' should be typed with one's right hand).

* Keyboard Maintainer: [smathles](https://github.com/smathles)
* Hardware Supported: Pro Micro
* Hardware Availability: Firmware; this repo!, Hardware; [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9e1f0d31a8394aa8d7623c60/w/c8f2cebee66fc5c32fb5229d/e/09752b9c4178eba7ffd03780) and... 
> TODO: add other hardware when I have the faintest idea what that will be

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/ohkb/:default
Also lmao the above doesn't work yet.

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
